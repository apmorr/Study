Longest Common Subsequence
-LCS is the longest ordered list of characters that are shared between two strings

-To find the LCS, we must compare the strings together
-we are looking through both strings and creating a list of characters that both strings have, while keeping the sequence of the characters in order
-the characters do not have to share indexes, but the must be the same characters, and come after the same characters
-if there are 3 matching characters in strings x:123 and y:132
-but one character comes before another in one string, and after another in the other, we cannot add both characters to the list


example 1:
S1 - a, b, c, d
S2 - a, c, b, a, d

Common Subsequences = ab, abd, acd, ad, cd
Longest Common Subsequence = abd or acd

example 2:
x - 12345
y - 132465

CS = 1245, 1345
LCS = 1245 or 1345

-in example 2, even tho both strings had a 2 after a 1, the x string has the 2 before 3 and the y string has the 2 after the 3
-therefore, because the characters dont appear in consecutive order, a common subsequence can not contain the string '123'
