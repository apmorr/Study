greedy algorithm

-a greedy algorith is an algorithmic strategy that makes the best optimal choice at each small stage with the goal of eventually leading to a globally optimum solution
-this means the algorith picks the best solution at the best moment without concern of consequence
-it picks the best immediate solution without considering the big picture, hence why its called greedy algorithm

-although in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution
-the idea is to take the biggest possible step
